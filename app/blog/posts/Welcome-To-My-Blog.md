### Hi, I'm Caleb Babione, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I've created this blog page, to be an "All about me page, but also a page, made to show off my skills/projects, and there are many different things I would like to do!

In the near future, I plan, to create something called a "hit-box" out of a few arcade buttons, and a Rasberry-PI Pico, as well, as get a new project car running, and who knows, I may even stream, or teach others about how to perform these tasks!

I love to play video games, and learning why things work. The best way to do both, is to learn something new, via trying to implement a skill that may improve/enhance, My experience with something I love to do!

For example, I host a Minecraft server, but they want new changes to be made often, and frankly, I don't have time, to configure a brand-new setup for them every time, and so I've developed a [Docker Container](https://github.com/CalebBabione/smp-mc-server) To automate the process of, editing/creating servers, for my friends and I, but that's not all! Most of my friends are not as tech savvy as I am, so  in an attempt to avoid making them think about anything, I've developed a Powershell script, to automate the process of installing the mods for them.

Now I spend Zero time helping them, as well, as significantly decreased the server's maintenance periods, thus increasing the time I can spend admiring my work! 

This is only the begginging though, there is more I'd like to do, and acheive, for example, my friends would like to be able to create their own worlds, to play how they want to, sharing their unique experience with others, and so I've been trying to learn JavaScript, and the Next.JS framework, and As you can see, I've successfully created my first website!

But it doesn't end here, I would like to use my newfound knowledge with Next.JS, and create a pipeline, so that my friends, may be able to create their own, desired server, at the press of a few buttons!


I really hope you stick along for my journey, as I've only just begun!

### Thank You for Looking at my site, it means a lot!!!
